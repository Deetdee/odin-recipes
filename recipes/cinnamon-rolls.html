        <!-- Picture of Cinnamon Rolls shrunk to a respectable size -->

        <p>Sweet Cinnamon Rolls are one of my favorite desserts, Whenever I see a Cinnabon restaurant I always get a six pack 
        to go. Originally from Sweden,</p> 
        <p>these circular delights are not only fantastic straight from the oven but also as leftover
        treats the next day. I have made this recipe plenty of times</p>
        <p>and it should provide a baker's dozen in a large baking dish and is best served with cold milk.</p>
